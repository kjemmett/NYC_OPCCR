1. process_expression.py
    script that first computes which genes are significantly 
    different in their expression between tumor/normal samples while
    also having a minimum variance within the tumor population.  only
    these F genes are admitted into our feature space.  txt files for
    the N tumor samples are created in ../dat/ containing F rows each.

2. raw2pandas_data.py
    script that reads in txt files from ../dat/ and formats final
    pandas dataframes for the main components of the data set:
        - N x F dataframe which is our X
        - N x 1 dataframe which is our Y
    these python objects are pickled in ../dat/

3. unsupervised.py
    script that attempts various embeddings and clusterings of
    on X.  Y is never invoked in these methods.  output is saved
    to ../out/

4. supervised.py
    script that attempts various regressions on the full labeled
    data set (X,Y).  output is saved to ../out/ and figures are saved
    to ../doc/
