1. process_expression.py
    script that first computes which genes are significantly 
    different in their expression between tumor/normal samples while
    also having a minimum variance within the tumor population.  only
    these F genes are admitted into our feature space.  txt files for
    the N tumor samples are created in ../dat/ containing F rows each.

2. raw2pandas_data.py
    script that reads in txt files from ../dat/ and formats final
    pandas dataframes for the main components of the data set:
        - N x F dataframe which is our X
        - N x 1 dataframe which is our Y
    these python objects are pickled in ../dat/

3. unsupervised.py
    script that performs exploratory data analysis including boxplots,
    scatter plots, histograms, PCA, and K-means clustering.  all figures
    are saved to ../doc/

4. supervised.py
    script that attempts basic regression and classification on the full
    labeled data set. supervised learning involves labeled data.
